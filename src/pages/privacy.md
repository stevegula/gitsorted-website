# Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** February 13, 2026

GitSorted is developed by Steve Gula. This policy describes how the GitSorted mobile application handles your data.

## Data storage

All data you create in GitSorted — task lists, shopping lists, notes, and associated metadata — is stored locally on your device as files within git repositories. GitSorted does not transmit this data to any server operated by Steve Gula.

## Remote sync

If you choose to sync a list with a remote git server (such as GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or another provider), your data is transmitted directly between your device and that third-party server using credentials you provide. Steve Gula does not act as an intermediary and does not have access to your data or credentials.

Your personal access tokens are stored in your device's secure keychain (iOS Keychain / Android Keystore) and are never transmitted to Steve Gula.

## Data we collect

GitSorted does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information to Steve Gula servers. We do not use analytics, tracking, or advertising SDKs.

## Third-party services

- **Apple App Store / Google Play Store:** Your purchase of GitSorted Pro is processed by Apple or Google. We do not receive your payment details. Purchase validation is handled by RevenueCat, which communicates with Apple/Google on your behalf.
- **RevenueCat:** Used to manage in-app purchase entitlements. RevenueCat receives an anonymous app user ID to verify your Pro status. See [RevenueCat's privacy policy](https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy/).
- **Expo Updates:** If enabled, the app may check for over-the-air updates from Expo's servers. No personal data is transmitted during this process. See [Expo's privacy policy](https://expo.dev/privacy).

## Children's privacy

GitSorted is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children.

## Changes to this policy

We may update this policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date.
