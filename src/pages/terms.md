# Terms of Service

**Effective date:** February 13, 2026

These terms govern your use of the GitSorted mobile application developed by Steve Gula.

## Acceptance of terms

By downloading or using GitSorted, you agree to these terms. If you do not agree, do not use the app.

## Description of service

GitSorted is a mobile application for managing task lists, shopping lists, and notes. Data is stored locally on your device as git repositories. Optional remote sync functionality allows you to push and pull data to third-party git servers using credentials you provide.

## Your data

You retain full ownership of all data you create in GitSorted. We do not access, collect, or store your data on our servers. You are responsible for backing up your data and managing your remote git credentials.

## In-app purchases

GitSorted offers a free tier and a Pro upgrade available as a one-time in-app purchase. Purchases are processed by Apple or Google through their respective app stores. Refund requests must be directed to Apple or Google per their refund policies.

## Third-party services

GitSorted integrates with third-party git hosting services (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Gitea, Azure Repos, AWS CodeCommit, and self-hosted servers). Your use of those services is governed by their respective terms and policies. Steve Gula is not responsible for the availability, security, or terms of third-party services.

## Disclaimer of warranties

GitSorted is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind, express or implied. We do not warrant that the app will be uninterrupted, error-free, or that data will not be lost. You use the app at your own risk.

## Limitation of liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, Steve Gula shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of GitSorted.

## Changes to these terms

We may update these terms from time to time. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.

## Contact

If you have questions about these terms, contact us at [legal@gitsorted.app](mailto:legal@gitsorted.app).
